Accessible Design Co.

This is a basic, responsive webpage featuring a navigation bar, key content sections, and a functional contact form. 

This template includes a Responsive Navigation Bar where the logo is on the left and links are on the right for desktop views. The layout is clean and includes standard sections: Hero, About, Feature Columns, and a Contact Form. Basic ARIA roles and labels are included to improve screen reader compatibility. Styling utilizes Google Fonts and the Font Awesome library.

This is a static website and requires no complex build tools. To set it up, simply download the project files (which include index.html, style.css, and script.js). You can run the project locally by opening the index.html file directly in your web browser.

The project is divided into three main files:

- index.html is the structure file. It contains the HTML markup, links the CSS and JavaScript files, and loads external fonts and icons.

- style.css is the styling file. It contains all the visual styles, including the Flexbox layout for the navigation bar and the media query that handles the mobile view functionality.

- script.js is the interactivity file. It contains the simple myFunction() logic used to toggle the responsive class on the navigation list (.nav) when the hamburger icon is clicked.

W3schools was a great help with this project.
